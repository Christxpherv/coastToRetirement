# coastToRetirement

The code figures out whether your retirment goal is acheievable through the initial deposit and annual contribtions to reach a target end goal with the 
interest rate that the bank offers. The code utalizes the interest formula to find out the total amount of interest that you will gain in x years and adds
it to your current amount. If the goal is achieveable, it will tell you how many contribtutions you have to make and if it is not, the program will tell
you that your goal is impossible.
